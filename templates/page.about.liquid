            <h2>Art For Humans Concept</h2>
            <p>Born through our founder's personal experience, both as a photographer and a charity board member, we have bridged the gap between artists, art buyers and charities by creating a unique charitable art marketplace.</p>
            <p>The artists submit their art pieces, set the price and can either give 100% or 50% of the income to their charity of choice. Art lovers can filter search through the marketplace and find their favourite pieces while supporting the greater community.</p>
            <p>Learn more about the concept and its benefits by watching the explainer video.</p>
